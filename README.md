# status.cafe-2-bsky
Simple python script that uploads the latest entry in a status.cafe (ie, your status.cafe) atom feed to bluesky.

currently, you need to manually run the script for this to actually do anything. in a future iteration i may make this into a more automated thing, so that you wont even have to think about it!
