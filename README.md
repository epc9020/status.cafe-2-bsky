# status.cafe to bluesky
Simple python script that uploads the latest entry in a status.cafe (ie, your status.cafe) atom feed to bluesky.

currently, you need to manually run the script for this to actually do anything. 
in a future iteration i may make this into a more automated thing, so that you wont even have to think about it!

## to do
figure out how to make links parse out correctly for bsky posts instead of it being spit out as a raw html `<a></a>`
